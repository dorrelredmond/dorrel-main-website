      <description>I was messing around with Bandlab on my phone and came up with this idea. I liked how it turned out and decided to turn it into a full song.

      <description>My first creation that I was truly happy with. Prior to this song, I had made a few things, but just was never satisfied, until this came along.

      <description>Arguably my favorite song I&amp;rsquo;ve made up to this point. I had a lot of fun with it and I love how it turned out. This song is what inspired me to truly pursue my music on a more serious level and I hope to create more amazing things as time goes on.
