DorrelRedmond: Catboy VTuber extraordinaire! 🎶 From chill Minecraft builds to spontaneous shenanigans, they're all about the vibes and laughs 😂 Whether farming, hunting, or heisting with friends, Dorrel's streams are a blend of chaos and creativity. This music-making, game-playing kitty promises fun and unpredictability! 🎮 Stay tuned for their next purr-fect adventure~

I've always had a fascination for content creation, so now here I am trying to explore what I can and learn as many new things as possible!

I'm a variety streamer, but I try to emphasize sandbox and puzzle games. That said, I like to try all kinds of things when I get the chance, from the occasional horror game to some exciting action/adventure games~

I'm very much a techy, so I tend to talk about a variety of tech in my channel, particularly streaming and vtubing related technologies. I could go on for hours about some of the crazy developments I find 😏

I also rather enjoy writing, so I may make a blog post from time to time on here 🖊️

My content continues to evolve as time goes on and I find what I enjoy and what works well. [Come hang out with me on stream and feel free to ask me anything](https://twitch.tv/dorrelredmond)
