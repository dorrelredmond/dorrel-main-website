My name is Dorrel Redmond. I'm a catboy that likes to make music :cat: :musical_score: I'm a vtuber, music producer, and amateur software developer. I've also been playing the violin for 12+ years at this point. 

I've always had a fascination for music and content creation in general, so now here I am trying to explore what I can.

When it comes to streaming, I'm a variety streamer, but I try to emphasize sandbox and puzzle games. That said, I'll try all kinds of things when I get the chance. 

I'm very much a techy, so I tend to talk about a variety of tech in my channel, particularly streaming and vtubing related technologies. 

I also rather enjoy writing, so I may make a blog post from time to time on here. 

My content continues to evolve as time goes on as I find what I enjoy and what works well. [Come hang out with me on stream and feel free to ask me anything](https://twitch.tv/dorrelredmond)
